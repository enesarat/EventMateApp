# EventMateApp


In this repository, the EventMateApp project is being developed. The aim of this project is to create an event management and interaction platform consisting of multiple modules. 


### Features

- Users register to the system by entering their name, surname, email address, and password information.
- Users who log into the system with their email address and password can view the information they provided during registration and change their passwords on their profile pages.
- When the system is launched, information is defined for an admin user.
- The admin user creates the necessary categories for events and edits the city information for locations while creating an event.
- The admin user reviews the events created by users and approves or rejects them.
- Users define an event by entering its name, date, description (for introduction, details, etc.), the city where it is held, its address, the number of participants allowed, and its category. They choose the category and city from predefined options in the system.
- Users can cancel the event they have created and update the number of participants and address until 5 days before the event date.
- Users view the predefined events in the system and participate in the ones they want by obtaining a ticket. Tickets are free. Each ticket has a unique number for the event and the person.
- When users enter the event area, their ticket numbers are checked by the gatekeepers.
